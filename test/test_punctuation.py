A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry
out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known
as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that
includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and
peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This
term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and
function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
